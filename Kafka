1) What is Data Log in Kafka?

As we know, messages are retained for a considerable amount of time in Kafka. Moreover, there is flexibility for consumers that they can read as per their convenience. 
Although, there is a possible case that if Kafka is configured to keep messages for 24 hours and possibly that time consumer is down for time greater than 24 hours, 
then the consumer may lose those messages. However, still, we can read those messages from last known offset, 
but only at a condition that the downtime on part of the consumer is just 60 minutes. Moreover, on what consumers are reading from a topic Kafka doesnâ€™t keep state.


2) How to verify where the zookeeper stores information about Broker id and Offset numbers? (if He knows ask to write command).

Here is the command to check both metadata of offset and offsets. The offsets are stored in Zookeeper in the in _consumer_offsets topic. 
$ kafka-console-consumer.sh --consumer.config /tmp/consumer.config --formatter "GroupMetaDataManager\$offsetsMessageFormatter" --zookeeper : --topic _consumer_offsets 
The above command gives metadata of console consumer.

3) What ensures load balancing of the server in Kafka?

Ans. As the main role of the Leader is to perform the task of all read and write requests for the partition, 
whereas Followers passively replicate the leader. Hence, at the time of Leader failing, one of the Followers takeover the role of the Leader. 
Basically, this entire process ensures load balancing of the servers.
