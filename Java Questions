1. Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?
 Yes, if other interface doesnot have abstract method
2. What is the lambda expression in Java and How does a lambda expression relate to a functional interface?

Lambda expression is a type of function without a name. It may or may not have results and parameters. 
It is known as an anonymous function as it does not have type information by itself. 
It is executed on-demand. 
It is beneficial in iterating, filtering, and extracting data from a collection. 
As lambda expressions are similar to anonymous functions, they can only be applied to the single abstract method of Functional Interface. 
It will infer the return type, type, and several arguments from the signature of the abstract method of functional interface.
