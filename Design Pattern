1. Strategy Design Pattern for encryption of documents
As part of the web services you are providing, a set of documents need to be encrypted before they are stored at a specific location in the cloud; say S3 bucket in AWS cloud.

Customer can choose various level of encryption, and there are cost associated with level of encryption and security. 
It may start with NULL encryption - which is basically no encryption. Apart from that, customer can choose from variety of encryptions 
such as "Triple DES", "RSA", "AES" etc.

2. Explain the working of a College internet or a Corporate Internet which restricts few sites access using design patterns.
PROXY DESIGN PATTERN.

Proxy Design Pattern provides controlled access of a functionality.The client, and each proxy, believes it is delegating messages to the real server.

The proxy first checks the host you are connecting to, if it is not part of restricted site list, then it connects to the real internet.

3. If you are working with an online trading application, you may want the functionality to queue trades placed after hours and process them when the stock market opens. You also need to asynchronously handle the order statuses sent from the stock exchange like partially-filled, rejected, fully filled, etc, and update the online order information. 
How will you go about solution this?

4. You need to change the logic of a module that several other modules depend on. How will you make the necessary changes without impacting the dependent modules?

5. spring version 2.3 - moving application to 2.5 version, getting conflicts because of dependency how will you reslove conflicts ?

6. Adapter design patter - structural.
Adapter design pattern - Software design pattern
You have two incompatible interfaces : MediaPlayer and MediaPackage. MP3 class is an implementation of the MediaPlayer interface and we have VLC and MP4 as implementations of the MediaPackage interface. We want to use MediaPackage implementations as MediaPlayer instances.

What design pattern will you use to work with two incompatible classes?


Ideal Answer (5 star)
ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN is to be used here.

An Adapter Pattern says that just "converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client wants".
In other words, to provide the interface according to client requirement while using the services of a class with a different interface.
The Adapter Pattern is also known as Wrapper.

Advantage of Adapter Pattern
 1. It allows two or more previously incompatible objects to interact.
 2. It allows reusability of existing functionality.


Usage of Adapter pattern:
 1. When an object needs to utilize an existing class with an incompatible interface.
 2. When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes which don't have compatible interfaces.
 3. When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes which don't have compatible interfaces.
