1. Why do we create INDEX? Write a syntax to create composite index.

CREATE INDEX index_name
on table_name (column1, column2);


2. Client has raised a ticket to optimize the existing SQL query, what all scenario you would think to optimize the query?
SELECT fields instead of SELECT * 
Create joins with INNER JOIN rather than WHERE 
Use WHERE instead of HAVING 
Use Index on frequently used where condition variables
