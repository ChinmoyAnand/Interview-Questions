Ideal Answer (5 star)
Each microservice has its own database. Some business transactions, however, span multiple service so you need a mechanism to ensure data consistency across services.
For example, lets imagine that you are building an e-commerce store where customers have a credit limit. The application must ensure that a new order will not exceed the customer’s credit limit. Since Orders and Customers are in different databases the application cannot simply use a local ACID transaction. Problem How to maintain data consistency across services? 
IMPORTANT: 2PC is not an option Implement each business transaction that spans multiple services as a saga. A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga. If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.
- [ ] What is the main objective of garbage collection?
GC 3 objectives: 1. Identify unused obj 2)clean unused obj 3)rearrange remaining obj to optimise memory usage
