1. What is observable in Angular and can you tell the difference between Promises and Observable?

Promise is async. It provides single value. Executes asap after creation. Promises can’t be cancelled. No operations are supported by Promises. 
Observables – both sync and async. Provides multiple values or stream of values. Can be executed whenever required (by using subscribe() method), 
can be cancelled using unsubscribe() method. It provides multiple operations like map, filter, reduce, etc.
